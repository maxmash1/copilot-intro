# Getting Started with GitHub Copilot Business: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction to GitHub Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered coding partner that helps developers write (brainstorm, test, explain, fix, document and more) better code faster. It offers two main components:

1. **Code Completion**: Suggests whole lines and blocks of code or comments as you type. 
2. **GitHub Copilot Chat**: An AI powered chat interface available both in your IDE and in the browser on github.com for software development-related questions and tasks

To get started, ensure you have:
- A GitHub account with Copilot Business subscription
- Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, or Neovim installed (no Copilot chat in Neovim)
- GitHub Copilot extension installed in your preferred IDE

## Getting Started with Copilot Chat

Copilot Chat is available in two environments:
1. In your IDE for direct coding assistance - [Chat](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide), [Code completion](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/getting-code-suggestions-in-your-ide-with-github-copilot).
2. On [GitHub.com for repository, pull request, issues, discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-github).
   - This can also be accomplished in the IDE with @github [skills](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/using-github-copilot/asking-github-copilot-questions-in-your-ide#using-github-skills-for-copilot)

#### Example chat prompts
1. **Code Explanation**
   ```
   Prompt: "Explain how this function works" or /explain
   Action: Highlight any code in the editor and ask Copilot to explain it
   ```

2. **Code Improvement**
   ```
   Prompt: "How can I make this code more efficient?"
   Action: Highlight any code in the editor and ask Copilot to explain it
   ```

3. **Documentation Generation**
   ```
   Prompt: "Generate documentation for this code"
   Action: Select code and request documentation in your preferred format
   ```

#### Example Code Completions
1. **Function Creation**
   ```
   Action: Type a function comment describing what you want
   Example: "// Function to validate email address using regex"
   ```

2. **Test Generation**
   ```
   Action: Create a test unit and describe what you want to test
   Example: "// Unit tests for email validation function"
   ```

3. **Error Handling**
   ```
   Action: Add error handling to existing code
   Example: Type "try {" and let Copilot suggest error handling
   ```

### Best Practices
1. **Write Clear Comments**: Better comments lead to better suggestions
2. **Use Natural Language**: Be descriptive in your prompts
3. **Review Suggestions**: Always verify Copilot's code suggestions
4. **Iterate**: If the first suggestion isn't perfect, try rephrasing or providing more context

Remember: GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool, but it's important to review and understand the code it generates. Always test the suggestions and ensure they meet your project's requirements and standards.
